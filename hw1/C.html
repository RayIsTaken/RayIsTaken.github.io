                <h2>C Language</h2>
            </div>

            <h3>1. What it is:</h3>
            <span>
                C is a powerful, general-purpose programming language that was designed in the early 1970s by <em>Dennis M. Ritchie</em> at Bell Labs.<br>
                It was originally developed to implement the UNIX operating system and soon became one of the most influential languages in computing history.
            </span>

            <h3>2. Key characteristics:</h3>

            <ul class="descriptionLanguage">
                <il>
                    <strong>- Procedural and imperative:</strong><br>Programs are written as sequences of instructions.
                </il>
                <il>
                    <strong>- Low-level access:</strong><br>Programmers can manipulate memory directly and interact closely with hardware.
                </il>
                <il>

                    <strong>- Portable and efficient:</strong><br>C code can run on many different processors and systems with minimal change.
                </il>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
            
            <h3>3. Why it matters</h3>
            <p>
                C's design emphasizes efficiency and minimal runtime — which makes it ideal for building software that is fast and resource-conscious.
                <br>It's still widely used in operating systems, embedded systems, compilers, device drivers, and high-performance libraries.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>4. Usage in daily life</h3>
            <ul class="descriptionLanguage">
                <il>
                    - Core parts of most operating systems (<em>e.g.,</em> Linux, Windows internally).
                </il>
                <il>
                    - Firmware on routers, appliances, and IoT devices.
                </il>
                <il>
                    - Performance-critical software (graphics, robotics, networking)
                </il>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Why it's worth knowing</h3>
            <p>
                Even though newer languages exist, C remains foundational — its syntax, concepts, and performance mindset influence many modern languages (including Java and Python).
